Repository for assignments and homework for the course "Scientific Python &amp; Pipelines".

# Homework 1

Here are my progress for the Git branching exercises from [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

## Files

- `HW1_part1.txt` - Hex representation of the first screenshot showing my progress
- `HW1_part2.txt` - Hex representation of the second screenshot showing my progress

## Reconstructing the Screenshots

The `.txt` files were created using the `xxd` utilite in Linux. To reconstruct the original screenshots, run the following bash commands:

```bash
xxd -r HW1_part1.txt HW1_part1.jpg
xxd -r HW1_part2.txt HW1_part2.jpg
